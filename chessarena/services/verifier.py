"""Strict paired-match verifier (section 14).

The final score never relies on cutechess's stdout alone.  This module parses
the pair's match.pgn, replays every move for legality, enforces strict color
swapping and identical openings, cross-checks the cutechess score line, checks
stdout/stderr, and verifies engine/opening provenance.

On any failure the pair is NOT scored and the whole tournament is marked

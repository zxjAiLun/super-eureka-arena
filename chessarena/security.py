"""Request security helpers (P2.4).

CSRF protection uses the double-submit-cookie pattern:
- each browser gets its own random ``arena_csrf`` cookie (set by
  ``CsrfCookieMiddleware`` with SameSite=Lax, HttpOnly, Secure behind HTTPS),
- every admin form embeds that random token as a hidden ``_csrf_token`` field,
- validation compares the submitted token against the cookie value, so a
  token stolen from one browser cannot be replayed with another browser's
  session, and there is no single global token shared by all clients.

State-changing API requests additionally reject cross-site Origin/Referer
headers; clients that send no Origin (curl, scripts, tests) are allowed.

The cookie middleware must be installed by the application factory.
